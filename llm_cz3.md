Perfect. Let’s move into **data taxonomy design** and a **3-month pilot project plan** that would allow your enterprise to evaluate, validate, and scale this LLM-driven symbolic project summarization and overlap detection system. I’ll break it into four parts:

1. **Conversation reiteration (executive digest)**
2. **Data taxonomy suggestion (structured classification of inputs/outputs)**
3. **Pilot project plan (timeline, milestones, resources)**
4. **KPIs (measurable outcomes for success/failure assessment)**

---

# 1. Conversation Reiteration (Executive Digest)

* **Problem statement**:
  Large enterprise with multiple divisions (20k–30k projects registered per division, ~10% active). Significant overlap exists between internal projects; some teams reinvent the wheel instead of reusing internal or open-source solutions. No mechanism exists for systematically detecting overlaps.

* **Solution concept**:
  Use an enterprise-fine-tuned LLM (base: Grok 4/5 or similar) to traverse internal databases and wikis via MCP connectors, compress unstructured descriptions into **symbolic descriptors**, and automatically detect overlaps. Provide structured outputs in JSON, including a symbolic descriptor, candidate overlaps, and graded match scores (0–10).

* **Implementation guidance**:
  A **prompt specification** was developed, including input schema, output schema, scoring methodology, symbolic descriptor rules, and examples. This ensures that the LLM can produce reusable, comparable representations of projects.

* **Next step requested**:
  Expand into a **data taxonomy** and **pilot plan** including resources, milestones, and KPIs for a 3-month corporate pilot.

# 2. Data Taxonomy Suggestion

The taxonomy must support:

* **Consistent compression of project data** into symbolic descriptors.
* **Cross-division comparison** between internal projects.
* **Mapping to external open-source repositories.**

### **Top-Level Categories**

1. **Administrative Metadata**

   * Project ID
   * Division / Business Unit
   * Status (Active, Archived, Planned, Deprecated)
   * Ownership (team, department)
   * Timeline (start date, current phase)

2. **Project Domain Classification**

   * Domain tags (AI/ML, Cloud, Networking, Hardware, Security, etc.)
   * Sub-domain tags (e.g., Cloud → Observability, Networking → SDN)
   * Maturity Level (Prototype, Alpha, Beta, Production, Open-Source)

3. **Symbolic Functional Core**

   * **Core Function** (compressed 1-sentence outcome descriptor)
   * **Inputs** (types of inputs: telemetry data, source code, hardware signals, etc.)
   * **Outputs** (main deliverables or results: models, services, bitstreams)
   * **Techniques/Methods** (algorithms, frameworks, design paradigms)

4. **Technologies & Tools**

   * Programming languages
   * Frameworks / Libraries
   * Infrastructure (Cloud provider, Kubernetes, FPGA, GPU)

5. **Deliverables**

   * Artifacts (e.g., "Inference accelerator driver")
   * Documentation
   * APIs or interfaces

6. **Overlap Analysis Layer (Derived Data)**

   * Symbolic Descriptor (hashable form for indexing)
   * Keywords (normalized, stemmed, deduplicated)
   * Internal Candidate Matches (with scores + rationale)
   * External Candidate Matches (with scores + rationale)

# 3. Pilot Project Plan (3 Months)

### **Goal of Pilot**

Demonstrate that LLM-generated symbolic descriptors can:

1. Consistently compress project data into comparable forms.
2. Detect overlaps between active internal projects and external open-source repositories.
3. Reduce project redundancy and provide measurable financial savings potential.

## **Phase 1: Preparation & Taxonomy Integration (Weeks 1–4)**

* **Tasks**:

  * Define taxonomy schema in JSON/Graph DB.
  * Build connectors (MCP, API) for ingesting corporate wiki and project registry.
  * Prepare 1,000 sample projects across 2–3 divisions.
  * Annotate a subset (100 projects) manually as gold-standard training/evaluation set.
  * Set up initial vector database for symbolic descriptors.

* **Deliverables**:

  * Working data ingestion pipeline.
  * Validated taxonomy and schemas.
  * Training/evaluation dataset with ground truth overlap annotations.

* **Resources**:

  * 2 Data engineers (ETL + connectors).
  * 1 Knowledge engineer (taxonomy design).
  * 1 LLM specialist (prompt fine-tuning).
  * Cloud compute (LLM fine-tuning + vector DB).

## **Phase 2: LLM Fine-Tuning & Prototype Matching Engine (Weeks 5–8)**

* **Tasks**:

  * Fine-tune Grok-5 (or chosen base model) with taxonomy and gold dataset.
  * Deploy pipeline that converts project abstracts → symbolic descriptors.
  * Implement scoring mechanism (0–10 scale).
  * Integrate open-source repositories as external comparison pool.
  * Run pilot overlap detection on 1,000 internal projects.

* **Deliverables**:

  * Prototype overlap detection engine.
  * First overlap reports with ranked candidates.
  * Dashboard for internal review of descriptors & overlaps.

* **Resources**:

  * 2 ML engineers (fine-tuning, evaluation).
  * 1 Backend engineer (API + storage integration).
  * 1 Open-source researcher (curate external repos).

## **Phase 3: Evaluation & Scaling Strategy (Weeks 9–12)**

* **Tasks**:

  * Evaluate precision/recall against gold-standard dataset.
  * Run end-to-end pipeline across 10,000 projects.
  * Collect user feedback (project managers, division heads).
  * Prepare cost-benefit analysis of avoided duplications.
  * Draft roadmap for full-scale deployment (all divisions).

* **Deliverables**:

  * Pilot report with quantitative KPIs.
  * Presentation to leadership with ROI potential.
  * Deployment plan for enterprise rollout.

* **Resources**:

  * 1 Program manager (coordinate evaluation).
  * 2 Data analysts (metrics, evaluation, reporting).

# 4. Suggested KPIs

  > *Target*: ≥85%.

* **Overlap Detection Accuracy**:

  > Precision & Recall of overlap detection against gold-standard.
  > *Target*: ≥75% precision, ≥70% recall at top-3 matches.

* **Compression Ratio**:

  > Ratio of input abstract length to symbolic descriptor length.
  > *Target*: ≥80% reduction while preserving functional core.

### **Business KPIs**

* **Detected Redundancy**:

  > % of projects flagged with ≥7 match score overlap.
  > *Target*: 10–20% in pilot sample.

* **Open-Source Substitution Potential**:

  > % of projects with ≥8 score matches to open-source alternatives.
  > *Target*: ≥5% of projects.

* **Cost Avoidance Estimate**:

  > $ value of potential duplication avoided (based on average project cost).
  > *Target*: Evidence of ≥$5M savings in pilot-scale extrapolation.

### **User/Adoption KPIs**

* **Reviewer Acceptance Rate**:

  > % of overlap recommendations validated by project owners as “true duplicates or partial substitutes.”
  > *Target*: ≥70%.

* **Time to Insight**:

  > Average time to generate descriptor + matches per project.
  > *Target*: ≤5 seconds per project.

✅ **Summary**:
The 3-month pilot would ingest a limited dataset (~10k projects), fine-tune an LLM to produce symbolic descriptors, compare them internally and against open source, and deliver overlap reports. Success is measured by descriptor consistency, detection accuracy, user validation rates, and potential cost savings.

Would you like me to also **draft a governance & compliance layer** (e.g., access controls, handling sensitive IP, and auditability of overlap detection decisions) as part of this pilot plan?
