Perfect. Since this is intended for **C-level / board-level presentation**, the best option is to format it as a **LaTeX-based white paper**. That way, you get a professional, typeset document that can be exported as a PDF with corporate branding and clean typography.

Below, I‚Äôll provide you with a **complete LaTeX draft** that can be compiled directly to PDF (via Overleaf, TeX Live, etc.). It includes:

* Title page
* Executive Summary callout box
* Section structure with consistent styling
* Placeholder for visuals (charts, tables, diagrams)
* Professional formatting (serif fonts, clear hierarchy, page numbers)

% Executive Summary
\begin{summarybox}
Large enterprises face a silent but costly challenge: project redundancy. Across divisions managing tens of thousands of projects, overlapping initiatives waste millions of dollars annually, slow innovation, and dilute competitive advantage.

This proposal recommends deploying a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to generate symbolic, reusable project descriptors, detect overlaps, and surface alternatives (both internal and open-source). A 3-month pilot is proposed, with measurable KPIs in technical accuracy, business savings, and adoption.

\textbf{Expected ROI:} Tens of millions in avoided redundant spend annually, with pilot costs of only \$1.5M.  
\end{summarybox}

\newpage

% Sections
\section{Problem Statement}
- Each division maintains 20k‚Äì30k projects; only 10\% are active.  
- Teams operate in silos, unaware of overlapping work.  
- Redundant R\&D efforts increase costs, delay delivery, and waste talent.  

\section{Proposed Solution}
Deploy an enterprise-grade LLM (e.g., Grok 5) to:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
  \item Ingest project abstracts and wiki pages.
  \item Generate symbolic project descriptors (compressed essence).
  \item Index descriptors in a vector + symbolic database.
  \item Compare new projects against existing ones.
  \item Assign overlap scores (0‚Äì10).
  \item Surface top-3 internal and top-3 open-source alternatives.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Symbolic Descriptor:} \textit{‚ÄúML-based anomaly detection and auto-remediation for Kubernetes telemetry‚Äù}

\section{Technical Architecture}
\subsection{Taxonomy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Administrative Metadata
  \item Domain Tags
  \item Core Function
  \item Inputs/Outputs
  \item Techniques/Tools
  \item Deliverables
  \item Overlap Layer
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workflow}
1. Ingest $\rightarrow$ 2. Summarize $\rightarrow$ 3. Index $\rightarrow$ 4. Match $\rightarrow$ 5. Score $\rightarrow$ 6. Review $\rightarrow$ 7. Retrain  

\section{Pilot Project Plan}
\subsection{Scope}
- Duration: 3 months  
- Sample: 10,000 projects (2‚Äì3 divisions)  

\subsection{Phases}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Month 1: Taxonomy, connectors, 1,000 labeled projects
  \item Month 2: Fine-tuning, symbolic descriptor generation
  \item Month 3: Evaluation, ROI analysis, roadmap
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Resources}
- ~8 FTEs (engineers, analysts, PM)  
- Infrastructure budget: \$1.2‚Äì1.5M  

\section{Governance, Compliance, and Change Management}
\subsection{Governance Framework}
- Transparency: Auditable outputs  
- Accountability: Human-led validation  
- Control: Oversight board for retraining and external access  

\subsection{Compliance \& IP Protection}
- Data remains private; no external APIs  
- Projects classified: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted  
- Open-source matches legally reviewed  

\subsection{Change Management}
- CIO/CTO sponsorship  
- Divisional ambassadors  
- Training for PMs  
- Incentives for reuse  

\section{KPIs}
\subsection{Technical}
- Descriptor consistency $\geq$ 85\%  
- Precision $\geq$ 75\%, Recall $\geq$ 70\%  

\subsection{Business}
- 10‚Äì20\% projects flagged redundant  
- 5\% substitution with open-source  
- \$5M+ in identified cost savings  

\subsection{Adoption}
- Reviewer acceptance $\geq$ 70\%  
- Division adoption $\geq$ 80\%  

\section{Business Case \& ROI}
\subsection{Strategic Benefits}
- Reduced redundancy, accelerated innovation  
- Optimized R\&D spend, enhanced knowledge visibility  

\subsection{ROI Estimate}
- Avoided redundant spend: \$40M annually  
- Open-source substitution: \$10‚Äì15M  
- Pilot cost: \$1.5M  
- ROI: $>$20x within Year 1  

\section{Next Steps}
1. Board approval for 3-month pilot funding  
2. Select pilot divisions  
3. Establish governance board  
4. Launch Phase 1: taxonomy + ingestion  

\section{Conclusion}
The LLM-driven symbolic summarization system provides not only a cost-saving mechanism but a strategic shift in innovation management. With governance-first deployment, the enterprise can capture tens of millions in savings annually while accelerating its competitive edge.

# ‚úÖ What You Get

* A **ready-to-compile LaTeX white paper** ‚Üí professional PDF.
* **Cover/title page**, executive summary, structured sections.
* Corporate-ready tone with **visual placeholders** (logo, charts).
* Designed to be board-appropriate and easily extended.

---

Would you like me to also **add corporate-style visuals placeholders** (flow diagrams for the pipeline, a Gantt chart for the 3-month pilot, and a financial ROI bar chart) directly as TikZ/PGF figures inside the LaTeX, so the PDF is ‚Äúpresentation-grade‚Äù without needing external graphics?
